# Roadmap

This is a roadmap of tasks and subtasks that I need to complete in order to have something approximating a working prototype of Labrys.

## TODO

- Front End
  - Feeds
    - Replies (ALL)
  - Blades
    - Individual Blade Permissions (ALL)
  - Private Messages (ALL)
  - Permissions Categories (ALL)
- Backend
  - Refactor to make less of a tangled mess
  - Make inbox messages more pluggable
